                <h1>HI!, I'M CLINTON.</h1>
                <p>I'm a 17 year old programmer, electronics freak, student, and an aspiring systems engineer. <br>Officially, my job is to solve problems through programming and engineering, but really all I do is help make the world a better place by making software and circuits that ease the world and help humanity at large.<br> I love  solving problems and creating efficient and beautiful websites and web-apps with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I live and school at Lagos, Nigeria. When I'm not programming or building electronic stuff with raspberry pi, I could either be connecting with humans on <a href="https://twitter.com/clinton_pi
                    ">twitter</a> , perusing old wisdom on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/9147408/clinton-nkwocha">stack overflow</a> or finding my inner peace. You could view my work on <a href="https://github.com/clintonpi/
                    ">github</a> and my plane code on <a href="https://repl.it/@Clintonpi/">repl.it</a>  and if you like to share an idea, form a team, hire or just contact me, you could leave a line at nkwochaclinton@gmail.com.<br> </p>
